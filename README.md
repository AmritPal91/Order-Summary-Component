## Overview

This is my first project that I have taken on the frontendmentor.io. I am very happy that I successfully completed this.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned to workthrough several css properties such positioning, rounding off corners, hovering etc and much more.

### Continued development

Divisioning and positioning techniques are those that I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to know more about css properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand html tags and css properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
